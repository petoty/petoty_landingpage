              Giving your pet a great life is never a waste of money. In fact, pet
              parents, like you, spend an estimated <span className="border-b border-gray-400">$18 billion</span> a year on veterinary
              expenses alone. While the amount may be shocking, the fact that we
              are willing to splurge to keep our pups healthy isn't surprising. After
              all, our dogs are family - a bond that spans the duration of our lives
              (and theirs). When we are faced with an expensive procedure or
              treatment, without a financial safety net, it can be heartbreaking.

              As early as 8 weeks, you can cover your precocious pup with a puppy
              insurance plan through Figo. Plans cover new injuries or illness-so, if
              your curious pet eats a sock or has a bout of diarrhea, simply visit the
              veterinarian, and submit your paid vet bill for reimbursement. Puppy
              insurance frees you to concentrate on more important things, like
              puppy playtime and snuggles!

              The total cost of cat ownership can reach over $3,000 in the first year -
              even without accounting for unforeseeable emergency expenses. Add
              in unexpected vet visits, and those costs increase. Fortunately, for a
              manageable monthly fee, you can purchase a cat health insurance plan
              and reduce worry from having to shell out exorbitant money for your
              cat's emergency care.

              If you're the lucky owner of a kitten, you know how inquisitive they
              can be. Kittens may get scared and dart out of the front door; and
              they may unintentionally nosh on dangerous and toxic non-edible
              items around the house. These common kitten mishaps can lead to
              vet bills that aren't in the budget. It is in these instances kitten health
              insurance can save your pet and your bank account.
